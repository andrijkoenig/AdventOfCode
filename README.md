# Advent of Code 2024 - C# Solution

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions in C#! ðŸŽ„

## ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨
**This code is bad. VERY bad.**  
- **Not performant**  
- **Not readable**  
- **Just for fun, by no means production-quality**

Please **do not** take any inspiration from it for your own projects. It was written in a hurry and with little attention to best practices. 
It's just me trying to solve puzzles, not building anything clean or optimized.
